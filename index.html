            <h2>Command shell overview</h2>
            <p>
                The command shell is a software program that provides direct communication between the user and the operating
system. The non-graphical, command shell user interface provides the environment in which you run characterbased
applications and utilities. The command shell executes programs and displays their output on the screen by
using individual characters similar to the MS-DOS command interpreter, Command.com. The command shell in
the Windows Server operating system uses the command interpreter, Cmd.exe. Cmd.exe loads applications, directs
the flow of information between applications, and translates user input into a form that the operating system
understands.<br><br>
You can use the command shell to create and edit scripts to automate routine tasks. For example, you can create
simple scripts in batch (.bat) files to automate the management of user accounts or nightly backups. You can also
use the command-line version of Windows Script Host to run more sophisticated scripts in the command shell. For
more information, see cscript or wscript. You can perform operations more efficiently by using scripts than you can
by using the user interface. Scripts accept all commands that are available at the command line.

            <h2>Customize the Command prompt window</h2>
            <p>
                You can change the properties for the Command prompt window.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open a Command prompt window, click the upper-left corner of the Command prompt window, and then click

                    increasing the number of buffers to five, you increase the number of lines in the Command prompt window to
                    5000.</li>

                        <li>In Window Size, increase Height.</li>

                            Left and Top.</li>
                    </ul>
